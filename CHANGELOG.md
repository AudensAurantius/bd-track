## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-04

Bundled release: queue surface refactor + `init-project` bootstrapping +
auto-push hang preventer + server discovery improvements. Breaks the
top-level queue CLI; queue commands now live under a single `queue`
parent.

### Added

- **`queue` parent command** with subcommands `push`, `unshift`, `pop`,
  `peek`, `list`, `remove`, `clear`, `clean`, `generate`, `prune`. Replaces
  the prior flat top-level commands. Each subcommand inherits the common
  `--scope` / `--project-dir` / `--titles` flags; `bd-timew queue --help`
  surfaces them in the parent's epilog.
- **`queue clean`** — mechanical sweep that drops closed/deferred beads
  from queue scopes. Wired into `bd-timew stop` so newly-closed beads
  drop out of any queue automatically; pass `--no-clean` to skip.
- **`queue generate`** — populate a queue from `bd list` filters
  (`--label`, `--label-any`, `--label-pattern`, `--status`, `--keyword`).
  `--append` extends; default replaces (with confirmation if non-empty,
  `--yes` to skip).
- **`queue prune`** — analytical audit: surfaces stale entries, scope
  mismatches (heuristic on `scope:local`), dependency-ordering issues,
  and missing blockers. Auto-applies destructive removals on confirmation;
  move/reorder recommendations are reported but require manual action.
  `--yes` skips confirmation for unattended automation.
- **`init-project --bootstrap` (default)** — runs `bd init` automatically
  when `.beads/` is missing, forwarding `--server`, `--sandbox`,
  `--prefix`, and `--agents-profile` flags from bd-timew's CLI. Resolves
  J121-xji ("init-project: bootstrap bd init when .beads/ is missing").
- **`init-project --sandbox` (default)** — forwards `--sandbox` to
  `bd init`, the empirically-safe setting that disables auto-sync during
  init and avoids hangs against an active git remote.
- **`init-project --prefix <prefix>`** — forwards an issue prefix to
  `bd init` when bootstrapping.
- **`init-project --agents-profile {minimal,full}`** — defaults to `full`
  so the generated AGENTS.md carries the full bd command reference.
- **Auto-push hang preventer** in `init-project`: writes
  `dolt.auto-push: false` directly to `.beads/config.yaml` BEFORE any
  `bd config set` invocation, breaking the chicken-and-egg hang where
  the very write that would disable auto-push triggers an auto-push
  itself. Verified empirically (`~/Source/beads-test`, 2026-05-04).
- **`bd-timew servers` two-pass discovery** — in addition to listing
  registered repos from `~/.config/bd-timew/repos.yaml`, scans running
  `dolt sql-server` processes via `pgrep` + `/proc/<pid>/cwd` and
  reports any unregistered servers with a hint pointing at
  `bd-timew init-project --path <path>`. Resolves J121-a3v.

### Changed

- **CLI shape (BREAKING)**: removed flat top-level queue commands
  (`bd-timew push`, `bd-timew pop`, etc.). Use `bd-timew queue push`,
  `bd-timew queue pop`, etc. The old `bd-timew queue` (list contents)
  is now `bd-timew queue list`.
- `init-project` no longer sets `no-push: true` via `bd config set` — that
  key only gates the explicit `bd dolt push` subcommand and was unrelated
  to the auto-push hang. The actual disable lives in
  `_ensure_auto_push_disabled` writing `dolt.auto-push: false` directly.

### Fixed

- `bd-timew init-project` no longer hangs indefinitely on the first
  `bd config set` when the project shares its source-code git remote
  with bd's `sync.remote`. The new `_ensure_auto_push_disabled` path
  pre-empts the auto-push that previously fired during settings
  bootstrap.

### Notes

- `init-project --non-interactive` is intentionally *not* forwarded to
  `bd init` — the upstream flag has been observed to hang in bd 1.0.x.
  Callers running non-interactively must supply enough flags that
  `bd init` has no prompts to ask.
- `--global` flag and `beads_global` shared-server inbox: known to exist
  in upstream bd; not yet integrated into bd-timew commands. Tracked for
  v0.3.x.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-28

Initial pipx-installable release. Extracted from a personal
time-tracking workflow into a multi-module Python package.

### Added

- `start` / `stop` / `switch` / `status` / `resolve` — Beads + Timewarrior
  bridge: resolves a Beads issue's labels to a `(client, case, svc)`
  billing tuple via per-project sidecar (`.beads/bd-timew.yaml`), then
  starts/stops a tagged Timewarrior interval.
- `init-project` — registers a Beads project for bd-timew automation
  (sidecar scaffold, repos.yaml entry, optional Dolt server-mode wiring).
- `cleanup` — wraps `bd compact --days 7 && bd gc` for routine
  maintenance.
- `servers` / `server-stop` / `idle-stop` — Dolt SQL server lifecycle
  management for registered repos.
- Flat-top-level queue commands: `push`, `unshift`, `pop`, `peek`,
  `queue` (list), `remove`, `clear`. Replaced by the `queue` parent in
  v0.2.0.
- systemd user units for cleanup and idle-stop timers.
